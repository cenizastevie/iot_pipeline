# CloudFormation Template Outline

---

## 1. VPC and Networking
- Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with:
  - Public and private subnets.
  - Route tables and an Internet Gateway (IGW) for public-facing resources.
  - NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access.

---

## 2. Kubernetes (EKS) Cluster
- Create an Amazon EKS cluster to orchestrate the IoT pipeline:
  - Node groups (EC2 instances) for running Spark, Kafka, and other workloads.
  - IAM roles for EKS cluster management and worker node access.

---

## 3. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Define an ECR repository to store Docker container images for your IoT pipeline applications (e.g., IoT Simulator, Kafka producers, and Spark jobs).
- Add permissions for your EKS nodes or CI/CD pipelines to pull images from the repository.

---

## 4. MongoDB Atlas API Integration
- Use MongoDB Atlas (as itâ€™s not natively supported by CloudFormation) to:
  - Create a fully managed MongoDB cluster on AWS.
  - Use the Atlas API to automate provisioning tasks.
  - Store the database URI as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager.

---

## 5. IAM Roles and Policies
- Create IAM roles for:
  - EKS worker nodes (to interact with AWS services like ECR and Secrets Manager).
  - Applications requiring access to MongoDB or ECR.
  - Roles for CI/CD tools to push images to ECR.

---

## 6. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Create an Application Load Balancer to manage external traffic for services like Grafana or APIs deployed on Kubernetes.
- Define listener rules to route traffic to target services.

---

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
- Enable CloudWatch logging for:
  - EKS cluster and applications.
  - Network traffic through ALB.
- Set up metrics and alarms for resource utilization.

---

## 8. Auto Scaling
- Enable Auto Scaling for:
  - EKS node groups to scale based on workload.
  - ALB target groups to manage traffic spikes efficiently.

---

## 9. CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline to:
  - Build Docker images for applications.
  - Push images to ECR.
  - Deploy Kubernetes resources using AWS CodeDeploy or Kubernetes Engine.
